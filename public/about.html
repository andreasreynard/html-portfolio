<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Andreas Reynard Samsico. I was born in February 25th, 2004. I'm currently studying Informatics in Institut
  Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.</p>

<p>I now have both of my parents and 2 brothers. My bother which is older than me by 1 year is also studying Informatics
  in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, and my other bother which is younger than me by 1 year is studying International
  Relations in Universitas Airlangga.</p>

<p>I've won many math competitions in my life. In my university life, I'm a finalist of a competition when I was in 3rd
  semester, then my rewards replaced my grades of my Web Programming (this Udemy lesson I take now) course into all 100.
  I also achieved a bronze medal in an ON-MIPA PT competition that also replaced my Midterm Exam and the 2nd Quiz into 100
  recently.</p>
